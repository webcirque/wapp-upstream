A panel, for automatic fund statistics calculation.

Fully browser-side, only requires static server files to present.

## Installing
No server-side configuration required, because it is only a set of static files. It even works with only GitHub/GitLab Pages!

Download ZIP or TGZ archives from the releases, and then extract them somewhere you wish.
